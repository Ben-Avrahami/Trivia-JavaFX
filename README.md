<h1>Trivia JavaFX</h1>

<p>Trivia is a JavaFX application that allows users to play a trivia game by answering questions from a file. The game reads the questions and answers from the <code>TriviaQuestions.txt</code> file using the <code>ReadFile</code> class, and stores them in a list of <code>Answers</code> objects using the <code>Answers</code> class. The <code>TriviaController</code> class is responsible for handling user input and updating the game state, and the <code>TriviaLogic</code> class handles the logic of the game, including keeping track of the score and determining when the game is over.</p>
